# HackProdigies

Hack Prodigies is a project that I and my team  worked on during Buildspace Nights & Weekends Season 5. Itâ€™s a platform designed to connect developers through hackathons, events, and coding competitions. The project was a team effort, and I handled the frontend development of the website. The platform aimed to facilitate networking and collaboration among developers by providing a space where they can participate in various competitive and collaborative coding activities.
